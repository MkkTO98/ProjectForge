## Active Work
- `overview.md` now records the doctrine-aligned architecture purpose: MacroForge is the system for reducing recurring effort to build, maintain, validate, canonicalize, and use trusted macroeconomic data; trusted databases/datasets are outputs.
- `minimal-ai-assisted-canonicalization-layer.md` remains the accepted TASK-030 design for provider evidence, canonicalization runs, mapping/canonical-creation proposals, confidence/provenance/review state, accepted mappings, unit/comparability profiles, and re-canonicalization lineage.
- Historical decision-analysis notes remain evidence for the bounded sequencing through TASK-037.

## Needs Attention
- TASK-037 is complete. The next recommended architecture validation candidate is a bounded, file-backed proposal review-to-accepted/provisional state lifecycle simulation, but no TASK-038 has been created or approved.
- Frame that candidate as testing whether MacroForge can reduce future manual canonicalization effort while preserving trust, provenance, and review-gated semantic correctness. Preserve no unit conversion, report integration, database persistence, AI/model calls, new sources, or generalized metadata framework boundaries unless explicitly changed by a new task/decision.
